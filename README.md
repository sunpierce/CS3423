This assumes you have SDCC installed and this targets EdSim51. The generated .hex file should be one that can be loaded and run directly.
### ppc1: Cooperative Multithreading
Implement cooperative multithreading for an 8051 microcontroller, creating threads and managing explicit thread switching with `ThreadYield`.
### ppc2: Preemptive Multithreading
Extend cooperative multithreading to preemptive multithreading using timer-based preemption and interrupt service routines.
### ppc3: Semaphore Implementation and Bounded Buffer
Introduce semaphores for synchronization and test their functionality with a 3-deep bounded buffer.
### ppc4: Multiple Producers and Fair Scheduling
Test multithreading fairness by implementing multiple producers and analyzing scheduling to prevent starvation.
